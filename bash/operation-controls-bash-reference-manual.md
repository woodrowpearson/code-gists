# Operation Controls \(Bash Reference Manual\)

## 10.7 Operation Controls

`configure` recognizes the following options to control how it operates.`--cache-file=file`

Use and save the results of the tests in file instead of ./config.cache. Set file to /dev/null to disable caching, for debugging `configure`.`--help`

Print a summary of the options to `configure`, and exit.`--quiet--silent-q`

Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.`--srcdir=dir`

Look for the Bash source code in directory dir. Usually `configure` can determine that directory automatically.`--version`

Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure` script, and exit.

`configure` also accepts some other, not widely used, boilerplate options. ‘configure --help’ prints the complete list.
