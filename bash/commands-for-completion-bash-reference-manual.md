# Commands For Completion \(Bash Reference Manual\)

`complete (TAB)`

Attempt to perform completion on the text before point. The actual completion performed is application-specific. Bash attempts completion treating the text as a variable \(if the text begins with ‘$’\), username \(if the text begins with ‘~’\), hostname \(if the text begins with ‘@’\), or command \(including aliases and functions\) in turn. If none of these produces a match, filename completion is attempted.`possible-completions (M-?)`

List the possible completions of the text before point. When displaying completions, Readline sets the number of columns used for display to the value of `completion-display-width`, the value of the environment variable `COLUMNS`, or the screen width, in that order.`insert-completions (M-*)`

Insert all completions of the text before point that would have been generated by `possible-completions`.`menu-complete ()`

Similar to `complete`, but replaces the word to be completed with a single match from the list of possible completions. Repeated execution of `menu-complete` steps through the list of possible completions, inserting each match in turn. At the end of the list of completions, the bell is rung \(subject to the setting of `bell-style`\) and the original text is restored. An argument of n moves n positions forward in the list of matches; a negative argument may be used to move backward through the list. This command is intended to be bound to TAB, but is unbound by default.`menu-complete-backward ()`

Identical to `menu-complete`, but moves backward through the list of possible completions, as if `menu-complete` had been given a negative argument.`delete-char-or-list ()`

Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or end of the line \(like `delete-char`\). If at the end of the line, behaves identically to `possible-completions`. This command is unbound by default.`complete-filename (M-/)`

Attempt filename completion on the text before point.`possible-filename-completions (C-x /)`

List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a filename.`complete-username (M-~)`

Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a username.`possible-username-completions (C-x ~)`

List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a username.`complete-variable (M-$)`

Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a shell variable.`possible-variable-completions (C-x $)`

List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a shell variable.`complete-hostname (M-@)`

Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a hostname.`possible-hostname-completions (C-x @)`

List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a hostname.`complete-command (M-!)`

Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a command name. Command completion attempts to match the text against aliases, reserved words, shell functions, shell builtins, and finally executable filenames, in that order.`possible-command-completions (C-x !)`

List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a command name.`dynamic-complete-history (M-TAB)`

Attempt completion on the text before point, comparing the text against lines from the history list for possible completion matches.`dabbrev-expand ()`

Attempt menu completion on the text before point, comparing the text against lines from the history list for possible completion matches.`complete-into-braces (M-{)`

Perform filename completion and insert the list of possible completions enclosed within braces so the list is available to the shell \(see [Brace Expansion](brace-expansion-bash-reference-manual.md#Brace-Expansion)\).
