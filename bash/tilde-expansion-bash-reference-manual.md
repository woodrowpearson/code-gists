# Tilde Expansion \(Bash Reference Manual\)

## 3.5.2 Tilde Expansion

If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character \(‘~’\), all of the characters up to the first unquoted slash \(or all characters, if there is no unquoted slash\) are considered a tilde-prefix. If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible login name. If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the `HOME` shell variable. If `HOME` is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory associated with the specified login name.

If the tilde-prefix is ‘~+’, the value of the shell variable `PWD` replaces the tilde-prefix. If the tilde-prefix is ‘~-’, the value of the shell variable `OLDPWD`, if it is set, is substituted.

If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number N, optionally prefixed by a ‘+’ or a ‘-’, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would be displayed by the `dirs` builtin invoked with the characters following tilde in the tilde-prefix as an argument \(see [The Directory Stack](the-directory-stack-bash-reference-manual.md#The-Directory-Stack)\). If the tilde-prefix, sans the tilde, consists of a number without a leading ‘+’ or ‘-’, ‘+’ is assumed.

If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is left unchanged.

Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immediately following a ‘:’ or the first ‘=’. In these cases, tilde expansion is also performed. Consequently, one may use filenames with tildes in assignments to `PATH`, `MAILPATH`, and `CDPATH`, and the shell assigns the expanded value.

The following table shows how Bash treats unquoted tilde-prefixes:`~`

The value of `$HOME~/foo`

$HOME/foo`~fred/foo`

The subdirectory `foo` of the home directory of the user `fred~+/foo`

$PWD/foo`~-/foo`

${OLDPWD-'~-'}/foo`~N`

The string that would be displayed by ‘dirs +N’`~+N`

The string that would be displayed by ‘dirs +N’`~-N`

The string that would be displayed by ‘dirs -N’

Bash also performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the conditions of variable assignments \(see [Shell Parameters](shell-parameters-bash-reference-manual.md#Shell-Parameters)\) when they appear as arguments to simple commands. Bash does not do this, except for the declaration commands listed above, when in POSIX mode.
