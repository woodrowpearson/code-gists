# Sample Init File \(Bash Reference Manual\)

Here is an example of an inputrc file. This illustrates key binding, variable assignment, and conditional syntax.

```text
# This file controls the behaviour of line input editing for
# programs that use the GNU Readline library.  Existing
# programs include FTP, Bash, and GDB.
#
# You can re-read the inputrc file with C-x C-r.
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
#
# First, include any system-wide bindings and variable
# assignments from /etc/Inputrc
$include /etc/Inputrc
