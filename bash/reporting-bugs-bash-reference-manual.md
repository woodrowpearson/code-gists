# Reporting Bugs \(Bash Reference Manual\)

## Appendix A Reporting Bugs

Please report all bugs you find in Bash. But first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the latest version of Bash. The latest version of Bash is always available for FTP from [ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/).

Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the `bashbug` command to submit a bug report. If you have a fix, you are encouraged to mail that as well! Suggestions and ‘philosophical’ bug reports may be mailed to [bug-bash@gnu.org](mailto:bug-bash@gnu.org) or posted to the Usenet newsgroup `gnu.bash.bug`.

All bug reports should include:

*  The version number of Bash.
*  The hardware and operating system.
*  The compiler used to compile Bash.
*  A description of the bug behaviour.
*  A short script or ‘recipe’ which exercises the bug and may be used to reproduce it.

`bashbug` inserts the first three items automatically into the template it provides for filing a bug report.

Please send all reports concerning this manual to [bug-bash@gnu.org](mailto:bug-bash@gnu.org).
