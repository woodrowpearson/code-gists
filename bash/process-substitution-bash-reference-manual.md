# Process Substitution \(Bash Reference Manual\)

## 3.5.6 Process Substitution

Process substitution allows a processâ€™s input or output to be referred to using a filename. It takes the form of

or

The process list is run asynchronously, and its input or output appears as a filename. This filename is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion. If the `>(list)` form is used, writing to the file will provide input for list. If the `<(list)` form is used, the file passed as an argument should be read to obtain the output of list. Note that no space may appear between the `<` or `>` and the left parenthesis, otherwise the construct would be interpreted as a redirection. Process substitution is supported on systems that support named pipes \(FIFOs\) or the /dev/fd method of naming open files.

When available, process substitution is performed simultaneously with parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.
