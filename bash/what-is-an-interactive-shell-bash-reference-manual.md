An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments, unless -s is specified, without specifying the -c option, and whose input and error output are both connected to terminals \(as determined by `isatty(3)`\), or one started with the -i option.

An interactive shell generally reads from and writes to a userâ€™s terminal.

The -s invocation option may be used to set the positional parameters when an interactive shell is started.
