## Bash Features

This text is a brief description of the features that are present in the Bash shell \(version 5.0, 12 May 2019\). The Bash home page is [http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

This is Edition 5.0, last updated 12 May 2019, of The GNU Bash Reference Manual, for `Bash`, Version 5.0.

Bash contains features that appear in other popular shells, and some features that only appear in Bash. Some of the shells that Bash has borrowed concepts from are the Bourne Shell \(sh\), the Korn Shell \(ksh\), and the C-shell \(csh and its successor, tcsh\). The following menu breaks the features up into categories, noting which features were inspired by other shells and which are specific to Bash.

This manual is meant as a brief introduction to features found in Bash. The Bash manual page should be used as the definitive reference on shell behavior.
