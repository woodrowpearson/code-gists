# Compound Commands \(Bash Reference Manual\)

## 3.2.4 Compound Commands

Compound commands are the shell programming language constructs. Each construct begins with a reserved word or control operator and is terminated by a corresponding reserved word or operator. Any redirections \(see [Redirections](redirections-bash-reference-manual.md#Redirections)\) associated with a compound command apply to all commands within that compound command unless explicitly overridden.

In most cases a list of commands in a compound commandâ€™s description may be separated from the rest of the command by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place of a semicolon.

Bash provides looping constructs, conditional commands, and mechanisms to group commands and execute them as a unit.
