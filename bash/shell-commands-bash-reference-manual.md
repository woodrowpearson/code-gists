# Shell Commands \(Bash Reference Manual\)

A simple shell command such as `echo a b c` consists of the command itself followed by arguments, separated by spaces.

More complex shell commands are composed of simple commands arranged together in a variety of ways: in a pipeline in which the output of one command becomes the input of a second, in a loop or conditional construct, or in some other grouping. • [Simple Commands](simple-commands-bash-reference-manual.md#Simple-Commands):  The most common type of command. • [Pipelines](pipelines-bash-reference-manual.md#Pipelines):  Connecting the input and output of several commands. • [Lists](lists-bash-reference-manual.md#Lists):  How to execute commands sequentially. • [Compound Commands](compound-commands-bash-reference-manual.md#Compound-Commands):  Shell commands for control flow. • [Coprocesses](coprocesses-bash-reference-manual.md#Coprocesses):  Two-way communication between commands. • [GNU Parallel](gnu-parallel-bash-reference-manual.md#GNU-Parallel):  Running commands in parallel.
